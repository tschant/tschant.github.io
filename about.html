            <h4> Me </h4>
            <p>
                I graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in Computer Engineering. <br/>
                I have found my passion in software development. I enjoy solving the problems that can arise while programming.<br/>

            </p>
            <h4> Projects </h4>
            <p>
                I have done a lot of various projects for school, work, and independently.<br/>
                I have worked with a wide variety of languages, with my favorites being: Haskell, Racket, JavaScript, and Python. <br/>
                I like programming with functional languages because of the different way of thinking about a problem and how to solve it.<br/>
                The <a href='projects.html'>Projects</a> tab features some of my favorite projects; the projects that that were difficult for me to solve or that were fun to write and solve.
